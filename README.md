# My personal Python notes

For a while I needed to refresh my Python skills, but most of the resources I found were either too superficial or overwhelmingly long. To solve this, I decided to create my own set of concise notes. 

The structure is inspired by the [Python Programming Language Tutorial on GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python/python-programming-language-tutorial/), but adapted into short, code-oriented files.  

All explanations live directly inside the code as comments, so I can access them quickly without leaving the editor. The idea is not to build a full tutorial, but a practical reference that lets me start coding right away. Itâ€™s enough to have Python installed and run the file you want to review. For example:  

```bash
python3 1-input_output.py
```
Each file moves progressively through Python fundamentals, with examples kept short and easy to adapt. The goal is speed and clarity: write code fast, keep the essentials at hand, and avoid the noise of overly verbose guides.
